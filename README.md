Guess it Mini Challenge #8 
Peer Review- Daniel Decoito: There are some issues with the program. It works through the first playthrough but any subsucuent playthrough there are issuess. The main being that it does not allow you to enter in any more inputs to actually play again. I do like the user experience. The console prompts made it easy for me to understand what I needed to do as a user.
